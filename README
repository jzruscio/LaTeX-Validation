This is a validation script for LaTeX formatted articles submitted to the journal.  

The output of the app checks that the supplied template is not changed, ex, no extra packages, header information, etc.  
It also allows for the easy comparison of the converted LaTeX and the raw LaTeX.

MathJax is used for the LaTeX conversion.  

Please refer to the LaTeX guidelines: http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/latexGuidelines.action.
